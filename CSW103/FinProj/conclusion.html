<p>I greatly advise that you gather all the information 
you can about Ebola. Most recently planes are being 
stopped because of people on board saying they could 
have the Ebola virus. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/10/06/epidemiologist-stop-the-flights-now/"
 target="_blank"><i>The Washington Post</i></a>
 The American government is trying to stop the outbreak 
 of this disease but stopping flights would be a very tricky 
 task to fulfill. However, anything to help stop the spread would 
 be beneficial and to keep America out of the contagious areas.
 If the right action isn't taken by people the disease could 
 cause a widespread outbreak. The disease isn't nearly as bad 
 as it is in Africa but if we don't take the right precautions
 the disease could become more developed and become a serious 
 threat.</p>
