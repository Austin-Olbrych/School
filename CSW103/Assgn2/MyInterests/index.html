<ul>
	<li><h3>Soccer</h3></li>
	<blockquote>I played soccer for most of my life but 
	sadly I wasn't able to continue my soccer career into college. Everyone has a
	favorite sport and mine just happens to be soccer. I hope that some day I can
	coach a kids team of my own.</blockquote>
	<li><h3>Music</h3></li>
	<blockquote>In middle school and high school I was part of the band. I've always
	loved music is why I was in the marching band during high school. I quit my 
	senior year because it conflicted with soccer but I still enjoyed playing
	and listening to music all the time.</blockquote>
	<li><h3>Video Games</h3></li>
	<blockquote>I grew up in a world where technology was entering the mainstream.
	I had a Gamecube growing up that a won at a contest at school and ever since
	I've always loved playing games and I wanted to grow up to know how they
	work and function.</blockquote>
