<h3>About me</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Austin Olbrych and this is what I look like. 
<a href="imageS/Austin.jpg">Picture of me!</a>
My favorite activities would be snowboarding and playing soccer. I played soccer in
 high school and I was part of ski club as well. The most unique thing about me is that
 I am a twin. I am the youngest twin but people say I am the better looking twin.
 My brother Evan, is attending Kent State University and people think it is hard to live
 without your twin, but it is really no different than having a brother or sister.
 Yes, we are identical and the one question most people ask is "what is the most annoying 
 part of being a twin" and it is when people always mix up your names and call me Evan.</p>
