<h3>Snowboarding</h3>
<img src="images/snowboarding.jpeg" height="100" width="100">
<p>I am a big fan of snowboarding and it has been something I loved to do since 
I was a little kid. One time my dad surprised my brother and I by taking us up 
to Cleveland to a ski resort. Ever since the first time I went snowboarding I 
fell in love with it. Once I entered high school I immediately signed up to 
join our schools ski club. My freshman year was fun, but I was a little rusty 
so it took me some practice to actually stay up. I wasn't able to participate 
my sophomore or junior year because I had back problems but I did join again my 
senior year. However, I did hurt myself during one of our trips to Peak'n Peek. 
My friend is much better then me but somehow he talked me into going off a couple
of jumps. So I tried it and the outcome wasn't very good. I ended up breaking my 
arm and this is what it looked like.<a href="Images/bone1.jpg">My Broken Arm</a>
 It did get better, I was told to let it hang so they put me in a sling but this 
 is what my arm looked like after 1 month and 2 months.
