<h3>Soccer</h3>
<img src="Images/soccerclip.jpg" height="100" width="200">
<p>I have played soccer for my entire life, and even won two district titles for
 division 3 and we came in second my senior year. I had plans to continue my 
 soccer career into college but sadly I couldn't because of the issues with my 
 back. Ever since our rivalry game in high school I became famous around our 
 town because of this picture. <a href="Images/soccer1.jpg">Newspaper picture.</a>
 I miss soccer very much and hope that some day I can get back out and play
  again.</p>
