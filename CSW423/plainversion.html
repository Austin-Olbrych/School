  <h2> An Experiment with Google Fonts </h2>

  <h3> developed by Sammy Student </h3>

      From Wikipedia:
  </p>
  <p>
      <b>Google Fonts</b> (previously called <i>Google Web Fonts</i>) is an interactive
      directory of free hosted application programming interfaces for web fonts.  It was launched in 2010 and revamped in
      2011.  Many of the fonts are released under the SIL Open Font License 1.1, while some are released under the
      Apache License; both are free software licenses. The fonts are also served by Monotype&rsquo;s SkyFonts and by
      Adobe&rsquo;s Edge Web Fonts and Typekit services.
  </p>
  <p>
      Google Fonts is designed to provide a platform for users to discover fonts and is used extensively.
      Its example font faces include <u>Lato</u>, <u>Raleway</u>, and <u>Lobster</u>.

      Google refreshed the look and feel of their website in 2016.
