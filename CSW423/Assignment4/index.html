	<h1>Welcome to the top!</h1>
  </div> <!-- end of pagetop -->
	
  <div id="person1">
	<h4> Carmelo Anthony </h4>
	<p> I am a big fan of Melo because growing up he was a basketball player I looked up to. Sadly, not many people view him the same way I do and that upsets me. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person1 -->

  <div id="person2">
	<h4> Zach Henkels </h4>
	<p> He is such a weird kid. He has this big dumb beard on his face and food almost always gets stuck in it for everyone to look at. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person2 -->

  <div id="person3">
	<h4> James McAvoy </h4>
	<p> This is one crazy individual. He was in a recent movie and goes wild on some teenage girls. He has over 20 personalities and each one is completely different in its own way. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person3 -->	  
	  
  <div id="person4">
	<h4> My Neighbor </h4>
	<p> No idea who this guy is but he lives in the strangest house and has the oddest things in his backyard. It's more of a junkyard because nothing seems like it would fit or make sense being in anyones backyard. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person4 -->

  <div id="person5">
	<h4> Kyle Shepard </h4>
	<p> Now you might know Kyle from previous computer classes but he is an interesting character. We recently went to Florida over spring break and this poor guy burned terribly. He looks like a lobster because he forgot to put on sun block the first day we got there. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person5 -->

  <div id="person6">
	<h4> James Morell </h4>
	<p> James is a good friend of mine but recently doesn't hang out with me much because he is super crazy into lifting. He has tried like five different diets during the semester and works out for hours every day of the week. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person6 -->

  <div id="person7">
	<h4> AJ Fisher </h4>
	<p> AJ just had his 21st birthday while we were on break so we held a little suprise birthday party for him. We got him pretty good but the poor kid was sick the entire week because he has really bad sinuses. Either way I still think he had a pretty good birthday. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person7 -->

  <div id="person8">
	<h4> Willie Rendek </h4>
	<p> He might be the only person I know that spells his name the way he does. He also got very mad at me when I first mispelled it. Willie is a stand up guy but knows when to dish it out if he has to. </p>
  </div> <!-- end of person8 -->

  <div id="person9">
	<h4> Blase Cindric </h4>
	<p> Professor Cindric is my favorite professor here at Mount. He is an awesome guy, great educator, and really cares about the well being of his students. In all, Blase really is one of the best teachers I've ever had. </p>
