        <p>Austin Olbrych</p>
        <p>Welcome to version one of assignment 2.
          Here I will talk about some of my favorite things to do.</p>

      <h2>Top 5 favorite activities</h2>
      <div id="divActivities">
        <ol>
          <li>Fishing</li>
          <li>Soccer</li>
          <li>Basketball</li>
          <li>Hockey</li>
          <li>Laundry</li>
        </ol>
      </div id="divActivities">
        <p>Now as you can see almost everything on this list is sports.
          It's normal for me because I am a very big fan of most sports so
          in my freetime I do spend a good amount of time participating
          in these sports. Laundry is also on that list, but NOT one of my
          favorite activities. I only put this on my list because I do laundry
          a lot so I figured I would add it to my list.</p>
        <h2>What I do at school</h2>
        <p>Some things I do here on campus are realated to my fraternity.
          I am our brotherhood chairman so I am alsways looking for
          fun things to do with all the brothers, and finding many exercises
          to strengthen the brotherhood of our fraternity. I also play a lot
          of intramural sports so I have a basketball team, soccer team, and
          even a water polo team. Sadly we don't have a fishing intramural team
          on campus.</p>
        <h2>Super powers I wish I had</h2>
