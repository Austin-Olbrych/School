    <p><b>Part A:</b><br><center><img src="answers.jpg" alt="Answers" style="width:200px; height 200px;"></center><br>
      My first website that I am analyzing as a good informational webpage is <a href="http://www.answers.com" target="_blank"> www.answers.com</a>.
      I like the visibility of this webpage because it has all search categories across the top of the page.
      This makes it very easy to change or define searches no matter where you are in the webpage. Also,
      the organization of different elements can help all kinds of users from beginners to experts. This
      is nice to look at and doesn't overload the user with information they don't need. The overall feel of
      the webpage is rather easy to navigate and provides the user with a nice feel when finding information
      on their site.<br>
      <br><b>Visibility</b>: Has simple feel initially, and navigation bar that follows the theme and easy to use.
      <br><b>Feedback</b>: When hovering over links or articles it would highlight the link. Very helpful that the webpage responds to
      user input.
      <br><b>Constraints</b>: When highlighting links, it shows what can be clicked on so the user knows what to click
      in order to find the correct location.
      <br><b>Consistency</b>: Like most webpages with navigation bar at the top to find specific topics. Search in the top left corner
      along with "log in" at the top write corners.
      <br><b>Affordance</b>: The search button is a magnifying class which is common, also links to social media using their icons.

    <p><b>Part B:</b><br><center><img src="aol.jpg" alt="Aol" style="width:200px; height 200px;"></center><br>
      My second website that I am analyzing as a bad informational webpage is <a href="http://www.aol.com/" target="_blank"> www.aol.com</a>.
      At first glance the webpage has organization with a navigation bar on the left side, which is consistent
      when an element is clicked, but has overwhelming amounts of information spread throughout the rest of the page.
      With all the pictures and videos being shown, it distracts the reader who is trying to find one specific
      article that is featured. Besides the webpage being overwhelming, it does have consistent elements that makes
      this page easy find exactly what you need. The visibility is poor because of all the on-screen pictures and videos,
      some of which are poor quality. The overall feel of this pages makes the featured items jump out however, if you are
      looking for something not featured, it may be difficult to find.<br>
      <br><b>Visibility</b>: Very overwhelming with videos, photos, ads, and scrolling images.
      <br><b>Feedback</b>: Buttons and icons with highlight when hovered over, mouse changing to a finger pointer, and image will change or show
      text by mouse of the image source.
      <br><b>Constraints</b>: No constraints allowing users to accidently click on things and possibly get lost on the site because they can't get back.
      <br><b>Consistency</b>: No consistence because all links, images, or videos go to new pages that are from other sites so you lose the similarity of the webpages.
      <br><b>Affordance</b>:Does have envelope for email, icons for social media, and three horizontal bar icon for settings or expanding menu.

    <p><b>Part C:</b><br><center><img src="etsy.png" alt="Etsy" style="width:200px; height 200px;"></center><br>
      My third website that I am analyzing as a good shopping webpage is <a href="https://www.etsy.com/" target="_blank"> www.etsy.com</a>.
      This webpage is well organized, great visibility, and consistent throughout the entire webpage.
      The navigation bar across the top of the page helps users find exactly what they need at any step of the webpage.
      The overall feel of the page makes it very easy to find everything you need, and has good feedback when users
      interact with the webpage. This webpage is very easy to use and allows user with no experience or master to
      get the item they are looking for.<br>
      <br><b>Visibility</b>: Simple design with lots of helpful information that isn't overwhelming.
      <br><b>Feedback</b>: Same as other webpages, links will change color, dropdown menus and interactive images.
      <br><b>Constraints</b>: Navigation bar across the top, shopping cart, sign in area, and search area.
      <br><b>Consistency</b>: Uses same design for all pages making it easy to navigate and always check cart or new items.
      <br><b>Affordance</b>: Uses a cart icon for actual cart, sign in button, and uses social media buttons as well.

    <p><b>Part D:</b><br><center><img src="nike.png" alt="Nike" style="width:200px; height 200px;"></center><br>
      My fourth website that I am analyzing as a bad shopping webpage is <a href="http://www.nike.com" target="_blank"> www.nike.com</a>.
      This page is unique and makes it difficult for new people to use, also overloads the user with information and videos
      they don't need to see. When opening the page, it has videos and pictures of people doing activities while wearing
      the product. This makes it interesting to see but isn't why the user came to the site. It takes many clicks
      to get to the place they need to be. It has a navigation board across the top to help users but isn't the same
      as most other websites. Because it is setup differently it can create issues for new users. It is well organized but
      has distractions that may make it hard for a user to focus on getting exactly what they need. <br>
      <br><b>Visibility</b>: Sometimes ask for location before showing site but site shows no product, rather shows images and videos of people wearing the product.
      <br><b>Feedback</b>: Changes mouse into finger pointer but hard to distinguish which images are links and not links.
      <br><b>Constraints</b>: Navigation bar across the top button requires many clicks because of subcategories making it hard to fully navigate.
      <br><b>Consistency</b>: has mostly the same design but each page is still overwhelming with images and images that change.
      <br><b>Affordance</b>: Has cart icon also icons of other brands, and search icon like most webpages.
