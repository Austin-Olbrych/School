    <p>This animation uses 7 objects: 1 Background, 1 Player, and 5 Fans</p>
    <p>All my objects are drawn, non of them are images.</p>
    <p>When the player begins to move, his arms and legs move along with him to make it look like he is running.
      The fans in the stands also are cheering so their arms and legs move when they jump up and down in the stands.
      Once the player reaches the basketball hoop he stops moving and can be reset with the reset button.</p>
    <p>The objects that move are done using an age parameter which is tested by if statements to allow it to move 
        the objects that are drawn.
